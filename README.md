# Topa-Ecommerce-Webpage
Project Overview:
Welcome to my internship project! This endeavor showcases my expertise in back-end development using Django and the Django REST Framework. I've embarked on building a dynamic e-commerce website, 
with a specific focus on crafting a robust backend infrastructure. In addition, I've integrated Stripe, a widely-used payment gateway, to facilitate secure and efficient online transactions. 
Please note that this project is still a work in progress.

Key Features:

Django & REST API: The heart of this project is the Django backend, featuring a set of RESTful APIs that power the e-commerce website. 
I've meticulously designed and developed models, views, and serializers to manage products, user profiles, and orders.

Stripe Payment Integration: To ensure a seamless shopping experience, I've incorporated the Stripe payment gateway. Users can securely make payments for their orders, enhancing the convenience and 
trustworthiness of the platform.

Ongoing Development: This project is continuously evolving. New features and enhancements are actively being added to improve its functionality and user experience.

How to Run:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up the Django backend following the instructions in the respective directory.
Ensure that the Stripe API keys are properly configured in your settings.
Run the Django server to start the backend.
