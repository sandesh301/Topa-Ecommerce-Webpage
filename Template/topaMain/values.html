		<h2>Ethical Values</h2>
		<p><b>Fair Remunation for Workers</b> We pay our workers 163% more than the government-recommended minimum wage. Realizing that the minimum wage set by the government is not enough to live a healthy quality of life, we have set our own minimum wage rate for our sta∆ã by discussing it with them. We review the wage rate yearly for all our employees.<br><br>
            <b>Safe & Comfortable Working Conditions</b>Our manufacturing facility is designed considering the safety and comfort of our workers. We provide ergonomic chairs for all our employees and protective gear which ensures their well-being.<br><br>
            <b>Transparent Sourcing & Operation</b>We provide all the information regarding the sources of the fabrics used for our garment production on our website. We also provide details about how we operate and what processes a garment goes through during production. Additionally, anyone can freely send us an
            email at <a href="">info@topanewyork.com</a> if they want to know any information regarding the brand.<br><br>
